# Transformation of relevés into Long Data Format Using Python Programming Language in development environment Pycharm

# Description
This Script  PyСharm (Python) focuses on processing data collected during monitoring  in Askaniia Nova Biosphere Reserve. The script automatically transforms a table from a wide format into a long format, adding such as unique event identifiers (eventID) (relevés number) and observation identifiers according to eventID (occurrenceID) and 'HumanObservation' (basisOfRecord) for all occurrences following Darwin Core standards for publishing event-dataset in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The output file is structured and ready for analysis or further publishing to GBIF.

# Requirements
PyCharm 3.7+
Libraries:
pandas

# Outputs
